		  		   									  	<p>Asian equities were down in May on the back of signals of possible withdrawal of the Fed’s QE programme, along with weaker than expected China manufacturing data for April. The country’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index reading fell to 50.6 as concerns remain that further weak data could feed into slower GDP growth for the second quarter. Elsewhere, Hong Kong was down as restrictions introduced earlier this year on the property market, as well as weaker China data, continue to weigh on sentiment. Meanwhile, in the much sought-after ASEAN markets, Indonesia, the Philippines, and in particular Thailand, all saw drops as investors took profits on the exceptional gains of the respective markets year-to-date. Indian equities also experienced losses as worries resurfaced over its GDP growth, which hit a decade low of 5% per year.

		  		   									  	<p>The current economic crisis has taken a toll on consumers globally, especially in developed markets. Financial deleveraging, ageing, job uncertainty and higher unemployment have all put pressure on consumption trends. As the world is slowly healing from one of the largest financial crises in history, we look at what is happening to the global consumer and identify the key trends for investors to watch. How important is the consumer to world growth? Are there emerging trends impacting global consumer spending patterns?

		  		   									  	<p>It is often commented that the Chinese economy exhibits destabilising imbalances, with investment spending having risen strongly in recent years and far outstripping private consumption as a share of GDP. However, there are reasons to believe that this high level of investment can persist for longer than many commentators suggest. The recent first quarter GDP release continued to suggest that the much vaunted rebalancing towards domestic consumption and away from investment has started, but it is likely be a long and slow progress.

		  		   									     <p>It has been onwards and upwards for equities during the first quarter but we have not seen major sell off in bonds. At the time of writing the S&P 500 has just passed its previous peak which was reached at the end of 2007 before the financial crisis. Risk appetite has remained strong as alongside abundant central bank liquidity, investor confidence has been boosted by signs of macro recovery and an outbreak of co-operation in the US Congress, where politicians have negotiated the fiscal cliff and lifted the debt ceiling.

		  		   									  	<p>The global economy continues to recover at a gradual pace in 2013 but it is difficult to see a major acceleration in activity as fiscal policy is set to tighten further and bank lending remains sluggish in the advanced economies. Within the global landscape, the improving picture in the US and China is largely offset by weaker activity in Europe, which leaves our forecast for global growth unchanged this year at 2.4%.

		  		   									     <p>The world economy continues to move at a sluggish pace in 2013 as fiscal policy tightens in the advanced economies whilst credit growth remains weak. Consequently, global growth is forecast to achieve a sub-par rate of 2.4%. While tighter fiscal policy will weigh on activity in the US, the recovery in the housing market, stronger corporate spending and improvements in the banking sector suggests that US growth is likely to gather pace, such that we have upgraded our forecast for this year and next.

		  		   									  	<p>The near term outlook for the eurozone remains bleak, with the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts showing 2013 as another year of falling output for the region. Better growth is desperately needed and there is a case for more cyclical support through easier monetary policy, but there are also structural obstacles to stronger growth. Unless these are addressed, any pick-up in growth will ultimately flounder. In this Talking Point I look beyond the near term cyclical challenges and consider what the eurozone needs to do to ensure its long term viability.

		  		   									     <p>At a meeting earlier this year, a participant posed an interesting question. “Why, in China, can we go from fears of a hard-landing to fears of overheating in such a short space of time?” The answer to this is likely to lie in the Chinese property sector, which we regard as the most important area of data to watch, and can swing (with the help of policymaking) rapidly between a slowdown and boom phase, with knock-on effects for the rest of the economy. In the middle of 2012, it was the more positive signs coming from this sector that gave us comfort that a hard landing would be averted. In the early part of 2013, it is the recent strength of this sector that is beginning to cause concern- in China, a buoyant housing sector is welcome, but an exuberant one is dangerous.

		  		   									  	<p>As one of the more developed Asian economies, Taiwan has gained a reputation as a leading exporter of cost-efficient technology products – and deservedly so. However, the past 12 months has seen the economy face the dual headwinds of falling demand in Europe and a slowing Chinese economy. This has reversed somewhat recently as the Chinese economy has picked up and European woes remain in the backdrop.

		  		   									     <p>The growth outlook for the BRIC economies have diverged since our last update in November, with China appearing to rebound more strongly but continued weakness in India, Russia and Brazil. These countervailing forces leave our overall 2013 forecast for the bloc little changed at 6.2% (previously 6.3%), but more biased towards growth in East Asia. In December we talked about the failure of the emerging world to decouple from the outcomes in the developed world, due to the importance of exports and capital inflows in providing the marginal contributions to growth. Thus the simultaneous upgrade of US growth in 2013 and downgrade for the Eurozone largely offset each other.

		  		   									     <p>Chinese equity markets pulled back in March as the investors took profit on the recent runup in prices. Further wariness was warranted as February data disappointed. China’s official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index came in at 50.1 for February, down from 50.4 in January. Although above the magic-50 mark, which indicates expansion, it was the second successive month of falling PMI readings. A further breakdown of the numbers revealed that the new orders index – a leading indicator of future activity – stalled as it registered a reading of 50.1, down from 51.6 a month earlier.

		  		   									     <p>Despite a better global backdrop, the Eurozone and UK have both been downgraded in our latest economic forecast. Both recorded worse than expected GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 2012, but the recent sharp moves in their exchange rates will pose further headwinds for their respective recoveries.

		  		   									     <p>We are upgrading our forecast for US growth in response to signs that the drag from last year’s inventory build-up is fading whilst orders are picking up. Tighter fiscal policy remains a headwind, but we are more confident that this will be offset by stronger private sector spending, primarily from the corporate sector. The upward revision is most apparent in our forecast for 2013 year-end growth in the US, which is increased to 2.6% year-on-year from a previous forecast of 2%. The calendar year forecast has risen from 1.9% to 2.1%, due to a strong base effect at the end of last year when GDP unexpectedly fell.

Firms that have previously been unable to access funding via the banking system, particularly small companies, have suddenly had potential new lines of credit opened up to them, a key driver in the rebound in activity we are currently observing.

Furthermore, contrast the West’s anaemic economic growth with that of Asia’s dynamic and fast-growing economies and its clear where the long-term potential is. And that’s exactly where the focus should be – on the long-term. Asia’s markets are still prone to the vicissitudes of monetary and fiscal policy in the US and Europe even as their growth is becoming more independent.

		  		   									     <p>On 4 March, 2013, we saw China’s Shanghai Composite benchmark slump by over 3.5%, in large part because of tightening measures on property purchases announced by the central government on 1 March, 2013. These measures included ordering cities with ‘excessively fast’ price gains to implement higher down payments and interest rates for second-home buyers. There was also an order to more strictly enforce a 20% capital gains tax.

		  		   									  	<p>As China’s growth rebound continues, with improving fourth quarter GDP, there are still opportunities for investors to benefit from the ‘China story’. Further recent data seems to have confirmed this. Improving manufacturing data, retail sales, trade figures and fixed asset investment (FAI) have all shown that a hard landing has been averted. Improvements in these key numbers have preceded a much-predicted pickup in GDP growth which has seen fourth quarter GDP come in at 7.9% - coming off a three-year low of 7.4% seen in the third quarter of 2012. The government will seek to maintain stability through a series of sustained economic and structural reforms as well as gradual liberalisation of interest rates, supported by continued investment in major infrastructure. However, we will not see a 2009-style mass stimulus, which is viewed as having been a mistake by authorities, as inflation problems came to the fore.

		  		   									     <p>2012 has been a year of double-digit gains in global markets – but for most global investors it has not felt so sanguine. But we are cautiously positive on the prospects for 2013. Equities are historically cheap versus bonds, and if the ‘near death experience’ of the global financial system is behind us we can now contemplate a rocky path to normalisation. Longer-term, investors must position themselves for the reality of a growth-saturated world in which sustainable growth and innovation will become the primary drivers of performance.

		  		   									     <p>Europe houses some of the best companies in the world; market- leading franchises, all too eager to take advantage of demand growth across global markets. For us, there is a wealth of neglected European ‘stars’, which are offering increasingly good value as fearful investors wait in the wings until the dust settles.

		  		   									     <p>Despite the fact that there has been little progress in resolving the underlying structural issues in the developed economies, 2012 has been a decent year for risk assets. Both developed and emerging equity markets have delivered reasonable returns against a difficult macroeconomic background. The MSCI World Index is up 13.7% year to date (as at 30 November) and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is up 12.7% (both in US dollar terms). Over the last three months however, emerging returns have been stronger with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index up 6.7% versus the MSCI World Index which is up 3.4%.

Encouraging December numbers saw this rally extended in the new year. December’s official manufacturing PMI expanded for the third month in a row, with the reading standing at 50.6, indicating a recovery that was gaining momentum.

		  		   									     <p>The investment case for Japan is sometimes written off by investors as just being the ‘same old story’. But we think these investors are missing an increasingly positive angle. Japan’s companies are evolving globally. M&A activity in the country is currently at a boom level which has given Japanese companies a competitive advantage and more exposure to international markets. We believe that this could be the catalyst for a turnaround in 2013.

		  		   									     <p>Asian bonds offer attractive yields in a low-yield world. Uncertainty around the eurozone crisis and the US ‘fiscal cliff’ will remain, but the relative macro strength of the Asian region and the attractive yields on offer should continue to support demand for this dynamic market. Currencies in the region have stabilized and some look set to appreciate gradually in year 2013. This has been a record in terms of Asian bond issuance in 2012 as more investors buy into the long-term story, and we see no reason why this can’t continue.

Encouraging October numbers saw manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investment (FAI) all rise substantially, despite third quarter GDP hitting a three-year low. The market consensus is that the GDP slowdown has now ‘bottomed out’ and growth will pick up in the fourth quarter.

The LDP won 294 seats out of 480, a clear single-party majority, and its coalition partner, Komeito, won 31 seats. This will give the coalition an over two-thirds majority, enough to drive legislation through parliament even if the Diet’s upper house (the House of Councillors) tries to block it.
